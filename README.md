Optimizing algorithms for computing the minimal spanning tree

University of Bonn, Summer 2015
Supervisor: Heiko RÃ¶glin (www.roeglin.org)

This project was done at the University Bonn within a group of three students.
The aim was to optimize the two well-known algorithms for computing a minimal spanning tree based on given papers.

1. Algorithm: Prim. Paper: "On sorting heaps, and minimum spanning trees" by Navarro et al.  https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/algor09.pdf

2. Algorithm: Kruskal. Paper: "The filter-kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm" by Osipov et al. http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/algo1-2014/alenex09filterkruskal.pdf

Alex and Florian mainly focused on the fist paper.
I focused on the second paper.

The author of each part of the code is mentioned in the code comments.
