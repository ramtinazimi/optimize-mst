Optimizing algorithms for computing the minimal spanning tree

University of Bonn, summer term 2015.
Supervisor: Professor Dr. Heiko RÃ¶glin (www.roeglin.org)

This project was done at the University Bonn within a group of three students.
The aim was to optimize the two well-known algorithms for computing a minimal spanning tree based on given papers.

1. Algorithm: Prim. Paper: "On sorting heaps, and minimum spanning trees" by Navarro et al.  https://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/ps/algor09.pdf

2. Algorithm: Kruskal. Paper: "The filter-kruskal minimum spanning tree algorithm" by Osipov et al. http://algo2.iti.kit.edu/documents/algo1-2014/alenex09filterkruskal.pdf

Alex and Florian mainly focused on the first paper.
I focused on the second paper.

At the end of the project we held a presentation and wrote a final paper concerning our results implementing the algorithms.
Both the presentation and the final paper are included. They are written in German.

The author of each part of the code is mentioned in the code comments.
